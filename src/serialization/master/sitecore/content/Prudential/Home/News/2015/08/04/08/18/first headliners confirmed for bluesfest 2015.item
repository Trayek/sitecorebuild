<p>Adopting a similar format to that used for this year&rsquo;s event, the festival will incorporate concerts in the Arena, indigo at The O2 and Brooklyn Bowl each evening and the first artists confirmed to perform include Grammy-winning blues-rock group&nbsp;Tedeschi Trucks Band, British blues star&nbsp;Jo Harman, and one of America&rsquo;s best-selling acts of the last ten years, the wildly popular&nbsp;Dave Matthews Band.</p>
<p>Running across three days from 6th &ndash; 8th November 2015, this will be the first time the world&rsquo;s number one music and entertainment venue has hosted a blues festival and coincides with the fifth anniversary of BluesFest, which has gone from strength to strength since launching in 2011 with concerts at a range of small London venues including the 100 Club, Union Chapel and The Jazz Cafe.</p>
<p>Festival Director Leo Green:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This move is a clear statement of ambition from all involved in BluesFest. Having grown exponentially over the last four years, it became clear that it was time to find a new and bigger home to cater to the growing demand for BluesFest.
